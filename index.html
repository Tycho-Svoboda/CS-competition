<h1 style="color:#0000DD;">Machine Learning From Scratch</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Our group wanted to learn Machine learning. However, we needed to know Python and machine learning concepts before we could do so.
  Initially we were just going to make a website using wix to teach you how to learn machine learning, but quickly realized that we wouldn’t be actually coding if we did so.  So we decided to learn HTML as well so that we’d actually be coding instead of just making a website about code.  We split up the three sections of HTML, Python, and Machine learning among my friends Sumedh, Tommy, and I, Tycho. Sumedh is in charge of the Machine Learning section, Tommy is in charge of the Python section, and I’m in charge of teaching v you guys HTML and creating the website.  If you came here for just the python/machine learning stuff, you don't need to learn the HTML stuff, however I would recommend skimming through it. Hope you enjoy!
  </p>

  <p>-Sincerely, Tycho from the development team of BC Waterloo</p>
  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p>HTML is a computer programming language that allows one to display content in the form of images, text, or videos.  HTML also provides an input function, so hopefully I’ll be able to implement that for some exercises for you guys.</p>
  <p>The framework of a web page is as follows:</p>
  <p>&lt;HTML&gt;</p>
  <p>&lt;HEAD&gt;</p>
  <p>&lt;TITLE&gt; Your Page's Title &lt;/TITLE&gt;</p>
  <p>&lt;/HEAD&gt;</p>
  <p>&lt;BODY&gt;</p>
  <p>The Body of Your Page</p>
  <p>&lt;/BODY&gt;</p>
  <p>&lt;/HTML&gt;</p>
  <p>The first and last lines of the sample code show that the website is indeed, in HTML.
     The in between the &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;/HEAD&gt; lines, you would put any headers, and in between the &lt;TITLE&gt; and &lt;/TITLE&gt; lines, you would put the title of your page.
     In between the &lt;BODY&gt; and &lt;/BODY&gt; lines, you’d put your paragraphs and images and stuff, which is fairly self explanatory.
     There are also many Style Tags that affect the way your text is displayed. They are listed below.</p>
  <p>    &lt;B&gt;bold&lt;/B&gt; </p>
  <p>    &lt;I&gt;italics&lt;/I&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;STRONG&gt;strong&lt;/STRONG&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;BLINK&gt;blink&lt;/BLINK&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;CODE&gt;code&lt;/CODE&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;EM&gt;emphasize&lt;/EM&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;ADDRESS&gt;address&lt;/ADDRESS&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;CITE&gt;citation&lt;/CITE&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;SAMP&gt;sample&lt;/SAMP&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;KBD&gt;keyboard entry&lt;/KBD&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;TT&gt;teletype&lt;/TT&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;BIG&gt;big print&lt;/BIG&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;SMALL&gt;small print&lt;/SMALL&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;SUB&gt;subscript&lt;/SUB&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;SUP&gt;superscript&lt;/SUP&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;STRIKE&gt;strikeout&lt;/STRIKE&gt;</p>
  <p>    &lt;PRE&gt;</p>

  <h2>Python</h2>
  <p>Python is a coding language that is very popular right now, and is being used for new technologies such as machine learning neural networks. It’s an interpreted language, meaning that it is translated to the machine during the execution of the program. Luckily for you, it is easy to learn and has basic syntax. We’ll be going over some basic coding concepts that are universal in every language, and go into the syntax python uses to represent those ideas.</p>
  <p><B>Variables:</B></p>
  <p>Variables are used to store data, and take up memory from the computer. Each variable has a name, and python will match the type (i.e integers, strings/words, etc.) The syntax, or way that you type the code so Python understands is:</p>
  <p>(varName) = (Data)</p>
  <p>Super simple, right?</p>
  <p>Let’s say you want to make whoever is looking at your code to have a better understanding of what your variable’s purpose is. To do this, you’d insert a comment, which is anything following a double slash as seen below.</p>
  <p>//This is a comment, the interpreter won’t use this while it runs</p>
  <p>When you mix comments with variables, your code will be easily understandable by anyone. In coding, it’s important that your code is understandable and reads out quickly to people not familiar for what you’re working on. For example, take a look at the following code, it tells you important information about the variable.</p>
  <p>//This variable is used to store the price of a gallon of milk<br>galMilkPrice = 2.20</p>
  <p>Variables should always be in camel case, which essentially means that each new word  after the first word is upper case, with the first word being lowercase.
    So instead of Gal Milk Price to represent milk gallon price, you would use galMilkPrice.</p>
  <p>Python will automatically assign a data type to the variable, based on what data you put in. For example, in the code above, galMilkPrice will be stored as a float (integer with decimal point), to match 2.20.</p>
  <p>Here are some important data types you should be familiar with:</p>
  <p><I>float</I> - a decimal number</p>
    <p><I>bool</I> - boolean, true or false value</p>
      <p><I>int</I> - integer, a non decimal number</p>
  <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p>
  <p>Applications of Machine Learning:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Amazon and Netflix recommendations</li>
    <li>Fraud detection</li>
    <li>Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It enables computers to quickly and automatically produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, more accurate results - even on a very large scale. By building precise models, and organization has a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities - or avoiding unknown risks.</p>
  <h3>Machine Learning Methods</h3>
  <h5>Supervised Learning</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Algorithms are trained using labeled examples, including an input where the desired output is known.</li>
    <li>The learning algorithm receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs, and it learns by comparing the calculated outputs with the correct outputs and identifying the errors.</li>
    <li>It uses methods such as classification, regression, prediction and gradient boosting to predict values on additional unlabeled data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Unsupervised Learning</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Used against data that has no historical labels - the system is not given the correct output.</li>
    <li>It learns and understands what is being given. The goal of the algorithm is to find a pattern or structure within the data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Semi-supervised learning</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Used for same applications as supervised learning</li>
    <li>Uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training</li>
    <li>Used when cost associated with labeling is too high for a fully labeled training process.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Reinforcement Learning</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>With reinforcement learning, the algorithm discovers through trial and error the most profitable actions</li>
    <li>Three primary components</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Agent (learner)</li>
        <li>Environment (what the agent interacts with)</li>
        <li>Actions (what the agent can do)</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Objective is for the agent to choose actions that maximize expected reward over a given amount of time.</li>
  </ul>
