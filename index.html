<h1>Machine Learning From Scratch</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Our group wanted to learn Machine learning. However, we needed to know Python and machine learning concepts before we could do so. 
  Initially we were just going to make a website using wix to teach you how to learn machine learning, but quickly realized that we wouldn’t be actually coding if we did so.  So we decided to learn HTML as well so that we’d actually be coding instead of just making a website about code.  We split up the three sections of HTML, Python, and Machine learning among my friends Sumedh, Tommy, and I, Tycho. Sumedh is in charge of the Machine Learning section, Tommy is in charge of the Python section, and I’m in charge of teaching you guys HTML and creating the website.  If you came here for just the python/machine learning stuff, you don't need to learn the HTML stuff, however I would recommend skimming through it. Hope you enjoy!
  </p>
  <p>-Sincerely, Tycho from the development team of BC Waterloo</p>
  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p>HTML is a computer programming language that allows one to display content in the form of images, text, or videos.  HTML also provides an input function, so hopefully I’ll be able to implement that for some exercises for you guys.</p>
  <p>The framework of a web page is as follows:</p>
  <p>&lt;HTML&gt;</p>
  <p>&lt;HEAD&gt;</p>
  <p>&lt;TITLE&gt; Your Page's Title &lt;/TITLE&gt;</p>
  <p>&lt;/HEAD&gt;</p>
  <p>&lt;BODY&gt;</p>
  <p>The Body of Your Page</p>
  <p>&lt;/BODY&gt;</p>
  <p>&lt;/HTML&gt;</p>
  <p>The first and last lines of the sample code show that the website is indeed, in HTML.
     The in between the &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;/HEAD&gt; lines, you would put any headers, and in between the &lt;TITLE&gt; and &lt;/TITLE&gt; lines, you would put the title of your page.
     In between the &lt;BODY&gt; and &lt;/BODY&gt; lines, you’d put your paragraphs and images and stuff, which is fairly self explanatory.
     There are also many Style Tags that affect the way your text is displayed. They are listed below.</p>

  
  <h2>Python</h2>   
  <p>Python is a coding language that is very popular right now, and is being used for new technologies such as machine learning neural networks. It’s an interpreted language, meaning that it is translated to the machine during the execution of the program. Luckily for you, it is easy to learn and has basic syntax. We’ll be going over some basic coding concepts that are universal in every language, and go into the syntax python uses to represent those ideas.</p> 
  <p><B>Variables:</B></p>
  <p>Variables are used to store data, and take up memory from the computer. Each variable has a name, and python will match the type (i.e integers, strings/words, etc.) The syntax, or way that you type the code so Python understands is:</p>
  <p>(varName) = (Data)</p>
  <p>Super simple, right?</p>
  <p>Let’s say you want to make whoever is looking at your code to have a better understanding of what your variable’s purpose is. To do this, you’d insert a comment, which is anything following a double slash as seen below.</p>
  <p>//This is a comment, the interpreter won’t use this while it runs</p>
  <p>When you mix comments with variables, your code will be easily understandable by anyone. In coding, it’s important that your code is understandable and reads out quickly to people not familiar for what you’re working on. For example, take a look at the following code, it tells you.</p>
