<h1>Machine Learning From Scratch</h1>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Our group wanted to learn Machine learning. However, we needed to know Python and machine learning concepts before we could do so. 
  Initially we were just going to make a website using wix to teach you how to learn machine learning, but quickly realized that we wouldn’t be actually coding if we did so.  So we decided to learn HTML as well so that we’d actually be coding instead of just making a website about code.  We split up the three sections of HTML, Python, and Machine learning among my friends Sumedh, Tommy, and I, Tycho. Sumedh is in charge of the Machine Learning section, Tommy is in charge of the Python section, and I’m in charge of teaching you guys HTML and creating the website.  If you came here for Hope you enjoy!
</p>
<p>-Sincerely, Tycho from the development team of BC Waterloo</p>
  
<h2>Python</h2> 
<p>Python is a coding language that is very popular right now, and is being used for new technologies such as machine learning neural networks. It’s an interpreted language, meaning that it is translated to the machine during the execution of the program. Luckily for you, it is easy to learn and has basic syntax. We’ll be going over some basic coding concepts that are universal in every language, and go into the syntax python uses to represent those ideas.</p> 
  <p><B>Variables:</B></p>
  <p>Variables are used to store data, and take up memory from the computer. Each variable has a name, and python will match the type (i.e integers, strings/words, etc.) The syntax, or way that you type the code so Python understands is:</p>
  <p>(varName) = (Data)</p>
