<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>Our group wanted to learn Machine learning. However, we needed to know Python and machine learning concepts before we could do so. Initially we were just going to make a website using wix to teach you how to learn machine learning, but quickly realized that we wouldn’t be actually coding if we did so.  So we decided to learn HTML as well so that we’d actually be coding instead of just making a website about code.  We split up the three sections of HTML, Python, and Machine learning among my friends Sumedh, Tommy, and I, Tycho. Sumedh is in charge of the Machine Learning section, Tommy is in charge of the Python section, and I’m in charge of teaching you guys HTML and creating the website.  If you came here for Hope you enjoy!
